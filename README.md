# Face-mask_detection-CNN-Keras
This GitHub repository is an innovative computer vision project that utilises Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with Keras. The primary goal of this project is to detect the presence or absence of face masks in images. This deep learning model is designed to enforce mask-wearing protocols and monitor compliance in various settings.
